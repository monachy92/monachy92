## 🎯 Professional Mission

In an era of $4.5M average breach costs, **security is a business enabler, not a roadblock.**

I am a Security Engineer focused on building **high-fidelity detection pipelines** and **automated response architectures**. My approach is rooted in the **Purple Team methodology**: I simulate real-world adversary TTPs to validate and harden defensive controls. 

By treating infrastructure as code and security as a continuous engineering discipline, I deliver measurable reductions in **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** and **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**, ensuring that security operations scale with business growth.

**Core Philosophy:** "To build an effective shield, one must first master the sword. I break systems to engineer the defenses that stop attackers in production."

## ⚠️ Active Research & Development Notice

> **"A security lab is never finished—it only evolves."**

Every repository in this portfolio is an **Active Research Lab**. These projects are in a constant state of iteration, testing, and refinement. They are not intended as "finished products" but as a transparent record of my ongoing engineering journey into cloud-native security, detection engineering, and automated response.

## 🤖 Human-in-the-Loop AI Methodology

I utilize the **Gemini CLI** as a strategic partner in this portfolio. My methodology is strictly **Human-in-the-Loop**, defined by these core principles:

- **No "Vibe-Coding":** I do not use AI to blindly generate or "vibe-code" solutions. Every line of code is reviewed, tested, and validated against real-world security benchmarks (CIS, NIST).
- **PoC & Strategic Design:** AI is used to scaffold Proof-of-Concept (PoC) architectures and provide strategic technical direction.
- **AI as a Senior Mentor:** I leverage Gemini as a technical mentor to deepen my understanding of complex topics, challenge my assumptions, and improve my technical writing.
- **Verification is Absolute:** No AI-suggested pattern is accepted without empirical verification in a controlled lab environment.
