**Architecting Resilience | Engineering Detection | Automating Response**

## 🎯 Professional Overview

I am a Security Engineer focused on building high-fidelity detection pipelines and automated response architectures. My approach is rooted in the Purple Team methodology: I simulate real-world adversary TTPs to validate and harden defensive controls. 

This portfolio showcases my hands-on experience in treating infrastructure as code and security as a continuous engineering discipline. My goal is to deliver measurable reductions in Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

## 🚀 Projects & Labs

### 🕵️‍♂️ [Purple Team & AppSec Pipeline](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/appsec-detection)
**Focus:** Attack Simulation vs. Automated Detection
- **What it does:** Automates the "Attack-to-Response" lifecycle using Wazuh and Python-based SOAR workflows.
- **Key Skills:** Manual OWASP Top 10 exploitation, custom Wazuh XML rule authoring, real-time threat mitigation.

### 🏗️ [Secure Supply Chain & Infrastructure Hardening](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/IaC)
**Focus:** Hardened-by-Default Infrastructure as Code
- **What it does:** Implements "Shift-Left" security patterns to detect and block misconfigurations at the point of commit.
- **Key Skills:** Automated scanning (Checkov, Trivy), Terraform, Bicep, Ansible, secret management via Gitleaks.

### 🔐 [Identity & Cloud Security Lab](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/identity-security-lab)
**Focus:** Hybrid IAM Lifecycle & Access Governance
- **What it does:** Automates the identity lifecycle to ensure consistency and least-privilege governance in hybrid environments.
