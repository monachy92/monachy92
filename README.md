**"I build security automation that reduces risk, cuts response time, and maps to what enterprise teams actually need — and I have lab results to back it up."**

## 🎯 Why This Exists
Modern security teams are overwhelmed by manual tasks and unverified alerts. This portfolio serves as a live engineering environment where I solve these problems by bridging the gap between offensive exploitation and defensive automation. Instead of just reading about security, I build it: exploiting vulnerable apps to write better detection rules and hardening infrastructure code to block attacks before they even reach production.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Portfolio
This is the executive hub for my security engineering labs. Every repository below is an active research environment focused on reducing risk via code.

| Project / Repository | Domain | Outcome / Business Impact | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Hardened Infrastructure Arsenal](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/IaC)** | **IaC / DevSecOps** | 6-stage CI/CD "Security Gauntlet" catching 100% of critical misconfigurations before deployment. | ✅ Active / Verified |
| **[AppSec Detection Lab](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/appsec-detection)** | **Detection Eng.** | Purple team lab reducing response time from ~60 mins (manual) to <60 seconds (automated). | ✅ Active / Verified |
| **[Security Analytics & Adversarial AI](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/security-analytics-lab)** | **Security Analytics** | Advanced statistical modeling and entropy-based anomaly detection for high-fidelity security log intelligence. | 🟡 Active Dev |
| **[Identity Security Lab](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/identity-security-lab)** | **IAM & Auth** | PowerShell/Entra ID automation for zero-trust lifecycle and automated stale account remediation. | 🟡 Active Dev |
| **[Kubernetes Security Lab](https://github.com/CloudSec-Jay/kube-home-lab)** | **Cloud-Native Def.** | Hardened K3s/Cilium environment focused on eBPF network security and zero-trust microsegmentation. | 🔵 Low Priority |

      +--(Active Response: <60s)--> [ Threat Mitigation ]
```

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **Time Savings:** Automated Active Response scripts reduce the window of exposure for SQLi and Brute Force attacks from minutes to seconds.
*   **Cost Avoidance:** The IaC Security Gauntlet identifies misconfigurations that cost $80 to fix in code vs. an estimated $8,000+ to remediate after a production breach.
*   **Risk Reduction:** Achieved a **95% detection rate** across the OWASP Top 10 through continuous offensive validation and rule tuning.
