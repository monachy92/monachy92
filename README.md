# Hi there! 👋

## 🔐 Cloud Infrastructure Security | 🤖 AI/ML Security Automation | 🏗️ Terraform Engineer

I am a **Cloud Computing student at Western Governors University** specializing in **Security-as-Code & Active Defense**. I bridge the gap between architectural design and defensive operations by building "secure-by-default" AWS ecosystems and utilizing AI to detect complex behavioral anomalies.

## 🏛️ Security Philosophy: "Defense by Design"

I believe that security is not a "bolt-on" feature but an inherent part of the build process. My approach centers on:
1. **Immutability:** Using **Terraform** to ensure infrastructure is predictable, version-controlled, and auditable.
2. **Observability:** Leveraging **AI/ML** to turn massive log data into actionable, high-fidelity intelligence.
3. **Resilience:** Building **Autonomous SOAR** pipelines that respond to threats at machine speed, not human speed.

## 🚀 Featured Security & AI Projects

### 📜 [Secure-by-Default AWS Baseline (Terraform)](https://github.com/monarchy92/secure-aws-terraform)
**Tech:** *Terraform, Checkov, GitHub Actions*
A library of production-ready Terraform modules that enforce the **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar**. Features automated GitHub Action gates that block any code failing **Checkov** or **OPA** security policies.

### 🤖 [Autonomous Cloud Sentinel](https://github.com/monarchy92/autonomous-cloud-sentinel)
**Tech:** *Python, AWS Lambda, SageMaker, EventBridge*
An automated SOAR pipeline utilizing Machine Learning to classify security findings. It programmatically isolates compromised assets and revokes IAM sessions based on anomaly scores detected by SageMaker.

### 🔍 [Neural-Honey: Proactive Threat Deception](https://github.com/monarchy92/neural-honey)
**Tech:** *Terraform, Python (Boto3), AWS CloudTrail*
Deploys "intelligent bait" across AWS using Terraform. This project creates decoy IAM keys and S3 buckets, triggering real-time SNS alerts if accessed by unauthorized actors.

### 🛡️ [Hardened KVM Micro-Cloud Cluster](https://github.com/monarchy92/hardened-kvm-cluster)
**Tech:** *Linux, KVM, Raspberry Pi, Python*
A bare-metal private cloud focused on host-level security. Implements micro-segmentation, kernel hardening (CIS Level 2), and localized AI agents to detect edge-level brute-force attempts.

---

## 📡 Live Lab Status
*Current environment for testing Cloud-Native security strategies.*

- **Hardware:** 4-Node Raspberry Pi 4 Cluster (ARM64) + 1 High-Compute KVM Host.
- **Edge Security:** Dual-stack pfSense firewall with automated SNORT IDS/IPS updates.
- **Observability:** ELK Stack (Logstash/Kibana) + Prometheus/Grafana for real-time traffic visualization.
